		// Pseudo Code for Hangman

		// 1. User hits any key to start the game

		// 2. User is presented with a series of empty slots representing a word they are trying to guess, and a word has been chosen from the array to use for the user to guess. 

		// 3. User guesses what letters are missing by typing letters on keyboard. Note* they only have 12 tries. 

		// 4. If user guesses correctly, the letter appears in the spot it should be at in the word. If they dont, letter appears in the guessed letter area, and one life is lost. 

		// 5. If letters are guessed that makes up word, then images change, and game starts again. If not, game over, and game starts again.
